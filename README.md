### Why NeuroCache?

Traditional cache algorithms (LRU, LFU, ARC) treat data as static.  
NeuroCache introduces **memory decay, reinforcement, and consolidation**, inspired by how the human brain learns.  
This allows systems to **adapt automatically** to changing data patterns and workloads.

---

### Key Advantages
- 🧩 **Adaptive Learning:** Dynamically adjusts to workload drift without manual tuning.  
- ⚙️ **Lightweight Integration:** Drop-in replacement for existing cache layers.  
- 🚀 **Performance Gains:** Sustains high hit rates even under non-stationary access patterns.  
- 💡 **Biologically Inspired:** Built on short-term and long-term memory modeling concepts.  
- 🔒 **Commercial Core:** GPU-ready obfuscated core available under commercial license.
